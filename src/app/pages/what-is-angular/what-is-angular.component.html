    <h2><b>What is Angular?</b></h2>
    <p>Angular is a development platform, built on typescript that includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
      <li>
          A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, 
          including routing, forms, management, client-server communication and more
      </li>
      <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test and update your code</li>

    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>
      Components are the building blocks that compose an application. A component includes TypeScript class with a <span class="item">@Component()</span> 
      decorator, an HTML template and styles. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="item">@Component()</span> decorator specifies the following information:
    </p>  
    <ul>
      <li>
        A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template. 
        HTML elements in your template that match this selector become instances of the component
      </li>
      <li>An HTML template that instructs Angular how to render the component.</li>
      <li>An optional set of CSS styles that define the appearance of the template's HTML elements</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Templates</h3>
    <p>Every component has an HTML template that declares how that component renders</p>
    <p>
      Angular extends HTML with additional syntax that lets you insert dynamic values from your component. 
      Angular automatically updates the rendered DOM when your componentâ€™s state changes.
    </p>
    <h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
    <p>
      Dependency Injection allows you to declare the dependencies of your Typescript classes without taking care of their instantiation. Instead, Angular
      handles the instantiation for you.
